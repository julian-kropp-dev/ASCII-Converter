# ASCII Converter
 This ASCII converter helps you to convert ASCII Code to its assigned characters and the other way round. This is quite useful, when you not only want to use sort algorithms for int and chars but also for any other ASCII letter. So e.g. you are able to sort Emojis by its ASCII tag.
